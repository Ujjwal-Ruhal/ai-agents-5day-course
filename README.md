# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive (Google x Kaggle)

This repository contains my work from the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive Program**.  
The objective of this program is to move beyond simple prompting and learn to build **AI Agents that can plan, reason, and take real actions using tools and interoperable system standards like MCP**.

## Day 1 – From Prompt to Action & Agent Architectures

### 🎯 Goal
Understand how AI agents transition from **raw prompts** to **structured reasoning** and **action execution**, and how different agent architectures influence this process.

### 📌 Concepts Covered
- Difference between standard LLM output vs. actual **agent reasoning**
- Thought → Action → Observation loops (ReAct-style reasoning)
- Prompt engineering for agent workflows
- Architectures for building intelligent agents

### 📓 Notebooks Completed

| Notebook | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Day 1 – From Prompt to Action** | Built a basic reasoning pipeline for agents. | https://www.kaggle.com/code/ujjwalruhal/first-day-assignment-from-prompt-to-action |
| **Day 1b – Agent Architectures** | Compared multiple agent architecture patterns and their tradeoffs. | https://www.kaggle.com/code/ujjwalruhal/day-1b-agent-architectures-e97b6f |

## Day 2 – Agent Tools & Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### 🎯 Goal
Learn how agents **use tools to perform real-world tasks**, and how **MCP standardizes interoperability** between models and external systems.

### 📌 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Agent Tools | Functions that allow agents to take actions (e.g., API calls, DB queries, external computations). |
| Model Context Protocol (MCP) | An open standard for connecting LLMs with external systems consistently and securely. |
| Tool Best Practices | Input validation, error handling, safe execution, predictable return structures. |

### 🧠 Why This Matters
Day 1 teaches the agent to **think**.  
Day 2 teaches the agent to **act**.  

This is the shift from:

## 🧭 Summary So Far
- **Day 1**: Built foundational understanding of agent reasoning and architecture.
- **Day 2**: Added the capability for agents to **use tools** and connect to external systems.

This is now evolving toward **practical, deployable agent systems** rather than theoretical LLM usage.
