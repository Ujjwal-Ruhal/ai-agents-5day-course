# 🤖 5-Day AI Agents Intensive (Google × Kaggle)

This repository contains my work from the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive Program**.  
The goal of this program is to move beyond simple prompting and learn to build **AI Agents that can plan, reason, and take real actions** using tools and interoperable system standards like **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.

## 🧩 Day 1 — From Prompt to Action & Agent Architectures

### 🎯 Goal
Understand how AI agents transition from **raw prompts** to **structured reasoning and real-world actions**, and how different **agent architectures** influence this process.

### 📌 Concepts Covered
- Difference between standard LLM output vs. true **agent reasoning**
- **Thought → Action → Observation** loops (ReAct-style reasoning)
- Prompt engineering for agent workflows
- Core **architectural patterns** for intelligent agents

### 📓 Notebooks Completed

| Notebook | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Day 1 – From Prompt to Action** | Built a basic reasoning pipeline for agents. | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ujjwalruhal/first-day-assignment-from-prompt-to-action) |
| **Day 1b – Agent Architectures** | Compared multiple agent architecture patterns and their trade-offs. | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ujjwalruhal/day-1b-agent-architectures-e97b6f) |

## ⚙️ Day 2 — Agent Tools & Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### 🎯 Goal
Learn how agents **use tools to perform real-world tasks**, and how the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** standardizes interoperability between models and external systems.

### 📌 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Agent Tools** | Functions that allow agents to take actions (e.g., API calls, database queries, or external computations). |
| **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** | An open standard that enables LLMs to interact with external tools, data sources, and APIs securely and consistently. |
| **Tool Best Practices** | Input validation, error handling, safety, and predictable return structures for reliable tool usage. |

### 🧠 Why This Matters
Day 1 teaches the agent to **think**.  
Day 2 teaches the agent to **act**.  

This marks the transition from *“language model responses”* to *“goal-oriented intelligent agents”* capable of meaningful interaction.

### 📓 Notebooks Completed

| Notebook | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Day 2a – Agent Tools** | Implemented tool calling and dynamic action execution inside agent workflows. | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ujjwalruhal/day-2a-agent-tools) |
| **Day 2b – Agent Tools Best Practices** | Applied reliability, structure, and safety patterns for tool interoperability. | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ujjwalruhal/day-2b-agent-tools-best-practices) |

## 💾 Day 3 — Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory  

### 🎯 Goal  
Learn how agents **retain context and memory** across sessions, enabling stateful, personalized, and consistent interactions.

### 📌 Concepts Covered
- **Context Engineering:** Dynamically managing context within an agent’s reasoning window.  
- **Session Management:** Maintaining isolated or shared conversation state depending on user or session scope.  
- **Memory Persistence:** Storing and recalling key details across sessions to create long-term memory.  
- **Stateful Conversations:** Using stored memory to improve continuity and coherence.

### 🧠 What I Explored
- Implemented **session state tracking** to observe how agent data persists per session.  
- Added **memory modules** to retain facts from previous turns or sessions.  
- Tested memory retrieval using practical conversational examples.  
- Observed how persistent memory enhances user experience in multi-turn dialogue systems.

### 📓 Notebooks Completed

| Notebook | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Day 3a – Agent Sessions** | Implemented session management and observed state persistence. | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ujjwalruhal/day-3a-agent-sessions) |
| **Day 3b – Agent Memory** | Built long-term memory persistence and verified cross-session recall. | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ujjwalruhal/day-3b-agent-memory) |

## 🧭 Summary So Far
- **Day 1:** Built foundational understanding of reasoning and agent architectures.  
- **Day 2:** Enabled agents to act — tool integration via MCP.  
- **Day 3:** Gave agents memory — stateful, context-aware behavior.  

Each step brings me closer to creating **practical, deployable intelligent systems** rather than just theoretical LLM demos.
